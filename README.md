# PicoKeyer
PicoKeyer is a CW keyer for the Raspberry Pi Pico that allows you to practice CW (morse code) in Desktop or Mobile browser that supports the [Web MIDI API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MIDIAccess#browser_compatibility). PicoKeyer also provide a USB MIDI interface that enables you to use any MIDI app of your choice to record or listen to your CW.

## Getting Started
You will first need a Raspberry Pi Pico based on the RP2040 chip. The Pi Pico is available in a variety of configurations, any of them should work. If you do not already have a Pi Pico, I recommend picking up either an original Raspberry Pi Pico or a Waveshare RP2040-Zero board as I have tested with both. You can find the original Raspberry Pi Pico, Waveshare RP2040-Zero, or a clone from $3-10/ea on Aliexpress, Amazon, or other retailers.

You will also need a way to connnect your RP2040 to your key. Most keys use a standard 3.5MM (1/8") stereo jack, however bare wire will also work fine. If yoou want to use the standard 3.5MM jack, I recommend the Lsgoodcare headphone jacks in the link below.
